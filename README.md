# TipCalc
A simple Java tip calculator

This program was created for a discussion in my CMIS 242 class. 

The specific instructions:
Give an example of a program that creates a GUI with at least one button and several textfields. Some of the textfields should be for input and others for output. Make the output textfields uneditable. When the button is clicked, the input fields should be read, some calculation performed and the result displayed in the output textfield(s).

This program accepts an input from the user and calculates either a 15, 20, or 25% tip based on the user's choice.

I used NetBeans GUI building tool to create this.
